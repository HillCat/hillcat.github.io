Briefly, an extension method is a special purpose *static method* that adds new functionality to an already-existing type without having to modify the original type you want to add functionality to.\n",

This method declaration also follows a standard idiom where the input and output types are `IEnumerable<T>`. That practice enables LINQ methods to be chained together to perform more complex queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, since you split the deck into halves, you'll need to join those halves together. In code, this means you'll be enumerating both of the sequences you acquired through `Take` and `Skip` at once, *`interleaving`* the elements, and creating one sequence: your now-shuffled deck of cards. Writing a LINQ method that works with two sequences requires that you understand how `IEnumerable<T>` works.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<T>` interface has one method: `GetEnumerator`. The object returned by `GetEnumerator` has a method to move to the next element, and a property that retrieves the current element in the sequence. You will use those two members to enumerate the collection and return the elements. This Interleave method will be an iterator method, so instead of building a collection and returning the collection, you'll use the `yield return` syntax shown above."

    "- using LINQ queries to aggregate data into a meaningful sequence\n",
    "- writing Extension methods to add our own custom functionality to LINQ queries\n",
    "- locating areas in our code where our LINQ queries might run into performance issues like degraded speed\n",
    "- lazy and eager evaluation in regards to LINQ queries and the implications they might have on query performance\n",
