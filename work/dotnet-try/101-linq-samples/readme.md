Learn how to use LINQ in your applications with these code samples, covering the entire range of LINQ functionality, demonstrating LINQ with objects. Once you've learned LINQ using object sequences, you can use LINQ with any supported data source. These samples leverage the interactive try.net experience in your environment.

## Exploring LINQ using this tutorial

To run these samples, you'll need to follow the instructions on the [dotnet/try-samples](https://github.com/dotnet/try-samples#basics) repository to install the global `dotnet try` tool in your .NET environment. 

Once you've installed the global tool, running `dotnet try` loads the samples into a browser. The browser pages introduce important concepts in LINQ, and you run the code interactively in your browser.

If you loaded this page from `dotnet try`, click [here](index.md) to start the sample. (This link will not work in the samples browser).
