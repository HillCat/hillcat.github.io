These explorations show you the structure of C# programs, working with text, numbers, and other core data structures.

## Learn to program using this tutorial

To run these samples, you'll need to follow the instructions on the [dotnet/try-samples](https://github.com/dotnet/try-samples#basics) repository to install the global `dotnet try` tool in your .NET environment.

Once you've installed the global tool, running `dotnet try` loads the samples into a browser. The browser pages introduce important programming concepts through interactive exercises you run in your browser.

If you loaded this page from `dotnet try`, click [here](index.md) to start the sample. (This link will not work in the samples browser).
